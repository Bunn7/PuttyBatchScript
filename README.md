# PuttyBatchScript
This script opens, putty, connects to saved connection, then executes neofetch.
If you dont want it to execute neofetch when it opens, remove "-m C:\path\to\cmd.txt -t"
Make sure to install both files, (not including the README.md ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) because the cmd.txt file executes the neofetch command.
